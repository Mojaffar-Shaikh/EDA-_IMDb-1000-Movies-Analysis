# Project_Exploratory Data Analysis on IMDb 1000 movies Dataset

Entertainment Industry is ever-growing high value earning sector in terms of revenue. And along with success, the popularity, wealth, fame and acclaim it brings are unparallel.

Therefore, this industry not only attracts aspiring actors, directors or individuals with related technical backgrounds but it also attracts a lot of wealthy investors who look to grow their wealth.

However, like any industry, success is not guaranteed, more so in entertainment industry as the success is decided by the viewers, critics & overall, the revenue earned by the movie. Hence, it requires lot of analysis with respect to the likes & dislikes of viewers, critics, trends, sentiments etc.
